# CMakeLists.txt & Makefile Templates

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little collection of **CMakeLists.txt** and **Makefile** templates! ðŸŽ‰ These templates are perfect for anyone whoâ€™s looking to set up a basic project structure quickly without all the hassle.

## How to Use

It's simple! ðŸ˜Ž Just navigate into the corresponding folder, and youâ€™ll find a ready-to-use template. No need for complicated setupâ€”just pick what suits your needs and youâ€™re good to go! ðŸš€

Hereâ€™s a quick reminder:

- **CMake** stuff? Itâ€™s in the `CMake` folder.
- **Makefile** templates? Head over to the `Makefile` folder.

Each folder has everything you need to get started. Just dive in and enjoy!

## Happy coding! ðŸ˜„âœ¨
